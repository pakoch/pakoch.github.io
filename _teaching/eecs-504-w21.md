EECS 504 is intended to lay a foundation for students looking to study or employ computer vision or other machine learning techniques in professional settings. It covers basic image manipulation (affine color transforms, image space transforms, convolution and pattern matching, corner detection, scale-space representations), computer vision problems and ideals (recognition, classification, segmentation, invariants), and modern methods (convolutional, recurrent, and transformer neural methods).
