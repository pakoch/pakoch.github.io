Hi there! My name is Parker Koch, and I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan. My professional interests include teaching future machine learning scientists both theoretical foundations and practical/ethical implications of doing ML work, discovering and mitigating bias of many kinds within deep models, and opening uncomfortable discussions about the permeation of corporate interests into the epistemology of the computer vision academy. I have a background in electrical engineering and signals, which strongly informs how I teach linear algebra and image analysis.

My work
======
I am currently spending time investigating why some neural networks exhibit "texture bias," as coined by [Geirhos, et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231), and whether we can use techniques from adversarial learning to address the issue. The intersection of deep learning techniques and bilevel optimization (such as with GANs) is, in my opinion, a far deeper and richer space of work than many in the CV community give it credit for. Its popularity within the fairness in AI community provides excellent further reason for studying how to improve it.

My teaching interests lie in Masters-level mathematics for signals and ML engineering students (linear algebra, matrix decomposition, filtering and estimation, etc.), as well as the fundamentals of machine learning methods both historical and modern. I have taught EECS 504: Foundations of Computer Vision at UM twice as a graduate student instructor and once as the primary instructor.

My background
======
I studied at the University of Iowa from 2010-2015, graduating with my BS in Mathematics and BSE in Electrical Engineering. I did research as an undergraduate aide alongside Drs. Raghuraman Mudumbai and Mona Garvin, and worked as a TA for several computer engineering classes with many other wonderful professors. Since then, I have been pursuing my PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan under Dr. Jason Corso, and received my MSE in 2018. I recently moved to Chicago to complete my degree closer to my family.

Non-academic life
======
Outside of work, I am an avid Magic: the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons player, and sometimes dabble with using machine learning in those spaces for fun. I ran the Bank of America Chicago Marathon in 2014 and will hopefully run more someday, but in the meantime I'm enjoying cycling around the Windy City with my friends.
